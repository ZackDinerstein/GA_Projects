        <p>I love hiking. Playing with my kids. I especiallly love being in the middle of nowhere with great friends. I also like riding and random subay line to the last stop and seeing where I end up.</p>

        <p>When I was 11 I patched the flat tire on my bike. When I was 18 I moved to Italy. When I was 19 I moved back and then moved to Montreal. I got married when I  was 28 and then had a bunch of cute kids</p>
